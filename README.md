# RideFlow — Real-Time Vehicle Sharing Platform

RideFlow is a production-style peer-to-peer mobility platform that enables users to list, discover, and book vehicles in real time.

The platform is engineered using modern full-stack technologies and cloud-native deployment patterns, featuring secure JWT authentication, Google OAuth, live booking workflows, scalable media uploads, role-based user management, and AWS-based production deployment architecture.

Built to simulate real-world distributed systems challenges such as booking concurrency, async workflows, authentication security, cloud storage, and scalable API communication.

## ⚡ Engineering Challenges Solved

### Booking concurrency

Implemented booking overlap validation so conflicting pickup/drop-off windows cannot be confirmed for the same vehicle, reducing double-booking risk in a request-based workflow.

### Authentication security

Integrated JWT for authenticated API access together with Google OAuth on the client; sensitive routes use middleware-backed authorization.

### Scalable media uploads

Delegated vehicle and profile images to Cloudinary instead of storing binary assets on the application server, keeping the API stateless and upload throughput scalable.

### Cloud deployment

Documented and aligned the codebase with an AWS-shaped deployment path: static frontend on S3 behind CloudFront, Node API on Elastic Beanstalk (or ECS), secrets externalized, DNS via Route 53.

### Role-based workflows

Separate flows for renters, vehicle owners (listing and rental requests), and admin-side verification review for optional identity checks.

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment Architecture

RideFlow maps cleanly onto AWS: **MongoDB Atlas** for data (recommended), **S3 + CloudFront** for the React production build, and **Elastic Beanstalk** or **ECS Fargate** for the Express API. Use **Route 53** for DNS and **Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store** for `JWT_SECRET`, `MONGODB_URI`, and OAuth configuration.

**Typical steps**

1. Provision Atlas; allow outbound from your compute tier; inject `MONGODB_URI` via secrets.  
2. Deploy the backend with environment variables (`PORT`, `JWT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `FRONTEND_URL` pointing at your CloudFront URL).  
3. Build the frontend with `REACT_APP_API_URL` set to the API URL; upload `frontend/build` to S3; front it with CloudFront (SPA fallback to `index.html`).  
4. Register OAuth origins for CloudFront and API URLs in Google Cloud Console.  
5. Replace simulated wallet infrastructure with a regulated payment provider before accepting real funds.

## 📈 Scalability Improvements

Planned production-scale enhancements:

- Redis caching for hot reads and session-adjacent data  
- WebSocket-based real-time notifications  
- Queue-backed async jobs (e.g. BullMQ)  
- Dockerized services and repeatable environments  
- Kubernetes orchestration for multi-service scale-out  
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions  
- Distributed booking and payment event processing  
- Payment gateway integration (e.g. Stripe)  
- Observability with Prometheus / Grafana
